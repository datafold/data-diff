# What's a Data Diff?
A data diff is the value-level comparison between two tables—used to identify critical changes to your data and guarantee data quality.

There is a lot you can do with data-diff: you can test SQL code by comparing development or staging environment data to production, or compare source and target data to identify discrepancies when moving data between databases.

# Use Cases

### Data Migration & Replication Testing
data-diff is a powerful tool for comparing data when you're moving it between systems. Use it to ensure data accuracy and identify discrepancies during tasks like:
- **Migrating** to a new data warehouse (e.g., Oracle > Snowflake)
- **Converting SQL** to a new transformation framework (e.g., stored procedures > dbt)
- Continuously **replicating data** from an OLTP database to OLAP data warehouse (e.g., MySQL > Redshift)

### Data Development Testing 
When developing SQL code, data-diff helps you validate and preview changes by comparing data between development/staging environments and production. Here's how it works:
1. Make a change to your SQL code
2. Run the SQL code to create a new dataset
3. Compare this dataset with its production version or other iterations

# dbt Integration

data-diff integrates with [dbt Core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) to seamlessly compare local development to production datasets.

# Get started

## Validating dbt model changes between dev and prod


## Compare data tables between databases
🔀 To compare data between databases, install `data-diff` with specific database adapters, e.g.:

```
pip install data-diff 'data-diff[postgresql,snowflake]' -U
```

Run `data-diff` with connection URIs. In the following example, we compare tables between PostgreSQL and Snowflake using the hashdiff algorithm:

```bash
data-diff \
  postgresql://<username>:'<password>'@localhost:5432/<database> \
  <table> \
  "snowflake://<username>:<password>@<account>/<DATABASE>/<SCHEMA>?warehouse=<WAREHOUSE>&role=<ROLE>" \
  <TABLE> \
  -k <primary key column> \
  -c <columns to compare> \
  -w <filter condition>
```

Run `data-diff` with a `toml` configuration file. In the following example, we compare tables between MotherDuck(hosted DuckDB) and Snowflake using the hashdiff algorithm:

```toml
## DATABASE CONNECTION ##
[database.duckdb_connection] 
  driver = "duckdb"
  # filepath = "datafold_demo.duckdb" # local duckdb file example
  # filepath = "md:" # default motherduck connection example
  filepath = "md:datafold_demo?motherduck_token=${motherduck_token}" # API token recommended for motherduck connection

[database.snowflake_connection]
  driver = "snowflake"
  database = "DEV"
  user = "sung"
  password = "${SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}" # or "<PASSWORD_STRING>"
  # the info below is only required for snowflake
  account = "${ACCOUNT}" # by33919
  schema = "DEVELOPMENT"
  warehouse = "DEMO"
  role = "DEMO_ROLE"

## RUN PARAMETERS ##
[run.default]
  verbose = true

## EXAMPLE DATA DIFF JOB ##
[run.demo_xdb_diff]
  # Source 1 ("left")
  1.database = "duckdb_connection"
  1.table = "development.raw_orders"

  # Source 2 ("right")
  2.database = "snowflake_connection"
  2.table = "RAW_ORDERS" # note that snowflake table names are case-sensitive

  verbose = false
```

```bash
# export relevant environment variables, example below
export motherduck_token=<MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN>

# run the configured data-diff job
data-diff --conf datadiff.toml \
  --run demo_xdb_diff \
  -k "id" \
  -c status

# output example
- 1, completed
+ 1, returned
```
